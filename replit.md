## Setup Requirements
### Discord Developer Portal Configuration
The bot requires these privileged intents to be enabled:

**Required Intents:**
- **Server Members Intent** - For auto-role functionality when new members join
- **Message Content Intent** - For processing message reactions and content

**Troubleshooting:** If you see "Used disallowed intents" error, ensure both required intents above are enabled in Discord Developer Portal > Bot section > Privileged Gateway Intents.

### Bot Invitation
You must invite the bot to your Discord server with proper permissions:

1. **Generate Invite URL:**
   - In Discord Developer Portal, go to OAuth2 > URL Generator
   - Select scopes: `bot` and `applications.commands`
   - Select permissions: Manage Roles, Manage Channels, Read Message History, Send Messages, Add Reactions, Use Application Commands, View Channels

2. **Use the generated URL** to invite the bot to your target Discord server

3. **Ensure the bot's role** is positioned high enough in your server's role hierarchy to manage other roles

### Environment Variables
- `TOKEN` - Discord bot token
- `CLIENT_ID` - Discord application ID
- `GUILD_ID` - Target Discord server ID
